Web Map Project
This repository contains the source code and resources for an interactive web map developed using Mapbox (or any other mapping library like Leaflet or OpenLayers). The web map allows users to visualize spatial data, interact with map features, and customize map layers and styles.

Features
Custom Map Style: A personalized map style with adjustable color schemes and layers.
Data Layers: Interactive data layers displaying points, lines, or polygons for various geographic features.
Popups: Clickable popups to provide detailed information about map features.
Search Bar: A search functionality to locate specific points or regions on the map.
Layer Control: Toggle visibility of different map layers (e.g., satellite view, streets view).
Zoom Controls: Buttons for zooming in/out to navigate the map efficiently.
Base Map Changer: Allows users to switch between different base maps (streets, satellite, terrain, etc.).
Technologies Used
Mapbox GL JS (or Leaflet, OpenLayers, or Google Maps API) for map rendering.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend development.
GeoJSON for spatial data layers.
Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (for managing dependencies and running the development server)
A Mapbox API key (if using Mapbox)
